🛡️ File Integrity Checker (SHA-256)

📌 Overview
This Python-based CLI tool verifies the integrity of files using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. It helps detect tampering, corruption, or unauthorized changes by comparing the current hash of a file with its expected hash.

🎯 Features
- Generate SHA-256 hash of any file
- Compare file hash against a known value
- Clear CLI prompts for user-friendly interaction
- Supports large files with buffered reading
  
🔧 How It Works
- Select a file to check.
- Tool computes its SHA-256 hash.
- You input the expected hash (optional).
- Tool compares and reports match/mismatch.
