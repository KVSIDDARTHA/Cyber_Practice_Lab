🗓️ Day 1: AES Message Encryption Tool
🔧 What I Built
A command-line Python tool that encrypts and decrypts messages using the AES algorithm (CBC mode). It includes:
- Secure key generation
- Padding for plaintext
- IV handling
- Base64 encoding for safe output
  
📌 Features
- Encrypt any text message with a randomly generated AES key
- Decrypt messages using the same key and IV
- CLI interface with argparse for usability
- Clear separation of logic into functions for readability
  
🧠 Why I Built It
AES is a cornerstone of modern cryptography. Starting with message encryption helps lay the foundation for secure communication tools. This project also reinforces:
- Key management practices
- Data integrity awareness
- CLI tool design for real-world usage
